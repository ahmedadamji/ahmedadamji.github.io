<h2>About</h2>
<p>
		I'm a roboticist and AI enthusiast who loves bringing ideas to life. I hold an MSc in Robotics and Computation with Distinction from University College London (UCL) and a BEng in Mechatronics and Robotics (Industrial) with First Class Honours from the University of Leeds. I bring 3 years of hands-on experience in key areas such as SLAM, Sensing, Perception, Manipulation, Navigation, and Path Planning. My programming expertise lies in C++ and Python, which enables me to efficiently create and implement innovative solutions.
		Throughout my educational journey, I've actively participated in prestigious international robotics competitions like RoboCup@Home, gaining invaluable hands-on experience. My year-long industry stint at BMW Group exposed me to a variety of AI and ML projects, where I applied my skills to tackle real-world challenges.
		I am deeply interested in autonomous driving, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent AI. Presently, I'm working on cutting-edge localization, mapping, and perception solutions for autonomous driving applications in the port industry. I am also preparing a research paper on a ground-breaking feature selection strategy for SLAM, aimed at reducing computational complexity.
		I welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for robotics and AI. Let's collaborate and work together to make a lasting impact on the world of technology!
