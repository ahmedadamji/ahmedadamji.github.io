							<h2>RoboCup@Home 2021 Open Platform League</h2>
							<p>
								While working on my final year dissertation at the University of Leeds, I was part of the <a href="https://sensiblerobots.leeds.ac.uk/" target="blank">Sensible Robots</a> research group to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future applications, evaluated using benchmark tests in realistic, non-standardised settings.
								As part of the research group's <a href="https://sensiblerobots.leeds.ac.uk/lasr/" target="blank"> Leeds Autonomous Service Robots</a> (LASR) team, I participated in the 2021 <a href="https://athome.robocup.org/rc2021/" target="blank">RoboCup@Home</a> Open Platform League, which is an international joint project to promote AI, robotics, and related fields. It is an attempt to foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing standard problems where a wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined.
								One of the challenges required to move objects spread around a room to their designated locations.
								In another challenge, we were required to provide a person with something from a shelf to consume when requested, avoiding obstacles while navigating.
								I worked towards tasks involving tidying up objects in the environment, depositing 5 items at their correct locations and providing a person with a requested item from a shelf while navigating avoiding small obstacles.

							<h2>Space Impact Recreated in Mbed</h2>
							<p>
								A University project that involved developing a game on a NXP KF-64 FRDM board on a handheld PCB gamepad. The developed is a recreation of the Space Impact game that was available on the Nokia 3310 mobile phones. Some additional mechanics inspired from shoot'em up style games were added which include player invincibility, reloading, and unkillable enemies. The game has no concept of an end, instead the player tries to maximise their score during each run until they die. Other basic features such as pause menus, difficulty settings, and a theme were also implemented.

							<h2>Robots for disinfection</h2>
							<p>
								The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to an increased need for disinfection, this is a task where robots can excel, since they are not at risk from the virus like humans. In this project the legged robot and a Husky A200 were used for disinfection tasks. I was tasked with setting up the necessary software to control the robot and the onboard pump system and implementing a pose estimation vision system for identification of disinfection targets. The project had <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-leeds-53699280" target="blank">news</a> coverage!

							<h2>Mobile Manipulation Using a Legged Robot</h2>
							<p>
								My main placement year project was the development of a mobile manipulation system using a Unitree Laikago quadrupped robot as the mobile platform. This covered a lot of aspects in robotics, manipulator kinematics, computer vision, embedded systems, navigation, 3D printing, and systems integration. Initially, the manipulator's weight was very close to the robot's maximum payload, so I had to design suitable modifications to reduce its weight. The project was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but various aspects of the system were implemented before that happened.
